# `abilists`

This repo is a Rust crate that parses `abilists` generated by the Zig project's
[`glibc-abi-tool` repository](https://github.com/ziglang/glibc-abi-tool/).

This repo is a **ðŸš§WIPðŸš§** nerdsnipe from [this tweet by Andrew
Kelley](https://mobile.twitter.com/andy_kelley/status/1470338795266457600).

## Getting started

1. Generate the `abilists` file in `deps/glibc-abi-tool`.
  1. Change your working directory to `deps/glibc-abi-tool`.
  2. Run `zig run ./deps/glibc`.
2. Run `cargo test` to check that you're generating the same output as the
  snapshot test in `tests/snapshot.rs`.
  1. We use [`cargo-insta`](https://insta.rs/) to generate new snapshots -- if
	you plan on doing anything to change the emitted output of a parsed
	`AbiList`, then you'll need to install it.
3. ðŸŽ‰Congrats, you're ready to start hacking on this project!
